## Clean or Messy Room Classification
#### 1. Problem Statement: classify hotel rooms
#### 2. Data Source: all the images are collected from google. Since, theis is the initial image classification exploring, we focus on collecting hotel room images that have less variation. There are 155 clean room images and 125 messy room iamges in the training dataset and in the test dataset we have 10 intotal 5 for both classes.
#### 3. Feature Engineering: the approach used in the feature engineering, which is mainly to find out the different rules between clean and messy room images.
#### 4. Model Construction: we include three cnn models: a baseline model, model with regularization, and model with transfer learning.
